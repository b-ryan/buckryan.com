Title: about

My name is Buck. I'm a developer living in Philadelphia working for
[RJMetrics](http://rjmetrics.com).

I love Clojure, Python, Bash, Vim, and more. At home, my time is largely spent
learning the cello (and soon piano!). Music has been a big part of my life, I
spent most of it playing the flute.
